## Introduction


The purpose of this investigation is to establish whether or not it is possible to predict future winning lottery numbers based on past winning results.
To do this, we will analyze the past 20 years of winning numbers for the [Mega Millions](https://nylottery.ny.gov/draw-game/?game=megamillions) lottery to answer the following questions:

- Is it possible to predict future winning lottery numbers based on previous results?

- Can a pattern be identified regarding which winning numbers are drawn most often per game over time?

- Does using these numbers increase our chances of winning?

- In terms of winning, is it better to play the same numbers, or pick different numbers every game?

- What strategies can be applied to ensure our chances of winning are increased (if any)?

- How do winning numbers correlate to payout amounts?

- What statistical theories are applicable to our goal, and which theories can benefit us (if any):

    - [Law of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)
    - [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)
    - [Gambler's Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy)
    - [Hot Hand Fallacy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hot-hand.asp#:~:text=The%20hot%20hand%20fallacy%20is,rolled%20it%20in%20the%20past)

Similar to previous studies, we want to understand whether or not it is possible to obtain an edge when playing the lottery. With the Data that we have gathered
(_From the nylottery and megamillions websites_), we will identify data trends and use simulations to answer the aforementioned questions. 
In addition to testing various "winning strategies", we also want to explore lottery payout amounts, as jackpot numbers change, and prize money expections.


### Mega Millions Lottery Game


Mega Millions is a US multi-state lottery game that is drawn twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays.
To participate in the game, players purchase one or more lottery tickets at a cost of $2 per ticket.
Players must pick **5** _unique numbers_ from **1** to **70**, and **1** number from **1** to **25** for the _Mega Ball_.
Optionally, players can opt for randomly selected numbers at the time of ticket purchase.


### Game Rules


Lottery numbers are drawn randomly **twice** a week on _Tuesdays_ and _Fridays_ at 11PM (EST). 
50% of lottery ticket sales is allocated as prize money (_75% of which is__used for the jackpot payout_). 
If all of the numbers selected by the player (_including the Mega Ball_) are drawn, then the player wins the jackpot. 
If multiple players win the jackpot, then the jackpot is divided equally among the winning players. 
If no one wins the jackpot for a particular drawing, then the jackpot amount rolls over to the next drawing. 
The remaining 25% of the prize money is then allocated to lower tiered prizes.

**Mega Millions Prize Tiers**

```{r, prizeTiers, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tableData <- data.frame(c("Jackpot", "Second Prize", "Third Prize", "Fourth Prize", "Fifth Prize",  "Sixth Prize", "Seventh Prize", "Eighth Prize", "Ninth Prize"),
                        c("5 matching numbers with the Mega Ball", "5 matching numbers", "4 matching numbers with the Mega Ball",
                          "4 matching numbers", "3 matching numbers with the Mega Ball", "3 matching numbers", "2 matching numbers with the Mega Ball",
                          "1 matching number with the Mega Ball", "No matching numbers with the Mega Ball"),
                        c("75% of the total prize money", "$1,000,000", "$10,000", "$500", "$200", "$10", "$10", "$4", "$2"),
                        c("1 in 302,575,350", "1 in 12,607,306", "1 in 931,001", "1 in 38,792", "1 in 14,547", "1 in 606", "1 in 693", "1 in 89", "1 in 37"))
                          
colnames(tableData) <- c("Prize", "Winning Criterion", "Payout", "Odds of Winning")

kable(tableData, caption = 'Prize Tiers and Payouts') %>%
      kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c('striped', 'hover', 'condensed', 'responsive')) %>% 
      scroll_box(width = '100%')
```

\ 

Additionally, Players can pay an extra dollar to purchase a multiplier number. 
Multiplier numbers range from **2** to **5**. 

If a player picks a winning multiplier number and also winning lottery numbers, 
then the payout for the winning lottery numbers will be multiplied by the winning multiplier number.

Most of these papers agree that trying to predict next weeks lottery numbers is absurd. Despite popular beliefs and fallacies, there is no reliable way to predict the lottery. If the odds of winning the lottery are so small, someone may ask: "how come people win all the time?".

Although the odds of winning the Mega Millions are about one in 300 million, people win all the time because millions of people play weekly.
While we agree with the overall consensus, that the lottery is unpredictable, we still want to see if there are any strategies to even get a slight edge when playing.

## Data Source

The main dataset that will be used for this project can be found on the [NY Open Data](https://data.ny.gov/) website,
and contains biweekly winning Mega Millions lottery numbers from 2002, through the current week. 
The dataset is in CSV format and can be accessed here:

[Lottery Mega Millions Winning Numbers: Beginning 2002](https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/Lottery-Mega-Millions-Winning-Numbers-Beginning-20/5xaw-6ayf/data). 

**Winning history**: https://www.megamillions.com/jackpot-history

**Drawing history**: https://www.megamillions.com/Winning-Numbers/Previous-Drawings.aspx

As of writing, the set consists of 2058 observations broken into 4 columns:

- **Draw Date**: _The date on which the lottery draw took place_.
- **Winning Numbers**: _The winning numbers for the given lottery draw_.
- **Mega Ball**: _The winning Mega Ball for the draw_.
- **Multiplier**: _The winning multiplier number for the draw_.


## Approach


It is impossible to evaluate our predictions against future winning lottery numbers so we will split the dataset into separate training, and test sets. 
The training set will be used to identify winning number patterns, and the test set will be used to establish if our predictions influence the winning numbers.


### Lottery Number Selection Strategies


There are several lottery number selection strategies that we need to simulate:\
      
**Same Number Selection**\
This is the simplist selection strategy. We will pick the 6 numbers required by the game (_5 unique numbers, and 1 Mega Ball number_) within the required range
(_1 to 70_ for unique numbers, and _1 to 25_ for the Mega Ball), and a **Multiplier** number within the required range of _2 to 5_.
       
**Random Number Selection**\
To simulate picking random lottery numbers, we will write a number generator in R that randomly generates the required 6 numbers and optional Multiplier number.

**Most Frequent Winning Numbers Selection**\
To generate number selections based on the most frequent winning numbers, we will write an R program that mines the training data and counts how often specific winning numbers occur. We will then rank these numbers and based on how high specific numbers rank, we will include them in our selection.


### Selection Strategy Evaluation


In order to evaluate which selection strategy (_if any_) is most effective, we will compare the strategy selections against the test data to evaluate which strategy results in winning selections most often. This will entail writing an R program that runs each individual strategy against the test data. The program will count the amount of times each strategy results in winning results, and rank them accordingly. Whichever strategy ranks highest, will tell us which strategy is most effective at predicting winning lottery results.

 
## Literature Review


Based on previous studies of the lottery we know that there are no ways to increase the probability of a ticket, but there are methods to maximize your winnings (Sutens, Ho). These studies show that previous results have no impact on future results (gamblers fallacy) and numbers that are frequently chosen are due to mere coincidence (hot hand fallacy). However, these studies also point out that following these gambling ideologies could actually be detrimental as picking popular numbers could increase the risk of having to split winnings with others (Sutens)


In a study against selected lotteries, it was found out that numbers with single digits (especially 1 and 9) and numbers with repeating digits, excluding numbers containing 7 and multiples of 7 (except for 7 and 77), were preferred by players (Otekunrin). The same study also found that players often chose numbers that were spread out and thus appeared to be random. This desire to pick numbers that appeared to be random was also seen in another where it was seen that combinations with greater variance between numbers were more attractive (Krawczyk)


The consensus among all of these studies is that all individual combinations are equally likely. Despite this, one could potentially increase their odds of winning by picking numbers in specific "behavior patterns" as these patterns obey different probabilities (Gianella). This study compared theoretical and observed probabilities of winning combinations and found that there were certain patterns that appeared more often than others.


## Methods

We hypothesize that based on how a player decides to play the lottery, the odds of them winning will change. Alternatively, their expected earnings will also change


In order to test the validity of our hypothesis, we will simulate the megamillions lottery based on its rules. In our simulation, we will randomly generate a string of 5 numbers and the megaball. This initial pull will determine the winning numbers in our "game". We then will pull other numbers (tickets), based on various methods, and compare with the generated winning numbers. 


The first method we will use to generate tickets are completely random. We will generate a random ticket for each random winning number. This will serve as our base case. We chose this as the base case as it is essentially playing the lottery with no strategy


The second method we will use is to generate one random ticket and then use that same ticket consecutively for multiple winning numbers. This will model a player using the same numbers, over and over, when playing the lottery.


The third method we will use is to generate random tickets, but only using "hot" numbers. These are numbers that won historically and appeared more often than others in previous jackpots. We will compile these numbers from real historical data provided by the megamillions. This trial is meant to simulate the hot hand fallacy and the gamblers fallacy


In all of these trials, we will evaluate the odds of winning (more than $2) and the average expected values
